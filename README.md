# Symptom Checker AI Agent

## Overview
This project implements an Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker that helps users understand their health conditions by analyzing symptoms and providing probable causes, preventive advice, and care recommendations. The AI agent retrieves verified medical data and symptom information from trusted sources such as WHO, government health portals, and medical journals.

Users can input symptoms in natural language (e.g., “I have a sore throat and fever”), and the AI provides possible conditions, urgency levels, home remedies, and guidance on when to consult a doctor. It supports multi-language interaction and emphasizes educational and referral-based suggestions to avoid self-diagnosis risks. This AI-driven assistant promotes early detection, reduces misinformation, and empowers users to make informed health decisions.
